This website is going to be the place for me to write some random thing that I want to share.

## This site used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as static site generator.
I was thinking about to try other static site generator. But the popularity and the total number of github stars of Hugo prevent me to try other alternatives. You can see other alternatives on this [link](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

## The theme used here is [Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis)

## This page is hosted in [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
I chose clodeflare pages because its free tier gives me unlimited badwidth. My other options are [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## I bought this domain from [cloudflare registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)
