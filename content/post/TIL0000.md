There is a lot of thing I want to post on my blog. But the problem is, either they are too political or they are too long to write. And I have decided to avoid politics on my blog. Only technical posts.

So this is a new series.TIL. If don't know, TIL means "Today I Learned". It will be one or two lines of things I have learned recently.

I numbered the TIL series as TIL0000 in the hope that I will publish 10000 posts one day.

## TIL0000

You dont have to do onehot encoding for [catboost.](https://catboost.ai/) Because catboost will automatically onehot encode if it find any catagorical feature. Sometimes it is a problem because for high cardinal data you will not always want onehot encoding. But sometimes it is a little nice thing to have.
